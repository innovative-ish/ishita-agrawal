                Hi, my name is Ishita Agrawal, a business analyst with a background in Computer Science and Engineering.

                I work on data, getting meaningful insights out of data is something I really like. Data visualization and Machine Learning are some techniques
                that I use to achieve my goal using different BI tools and technologies.
                
                I am a big open source believer since I think with sharing solutions and methods we can achieve a lot more as a community. Therefore, I prefer to use R and Python for my daily work.
                
                I have a passion for nature and environment and I would love to help you out of you have any project in those areas. However, I am open to other projects too.
                
                On my website you can find some examples of my work, the projects that I have practiced on, most of them are links to another page with the visualization.
                
                Have fun browsing through the content and thank you for visiting ! ❤️
